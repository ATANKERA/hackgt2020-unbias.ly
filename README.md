# hackgt2020-aggr
Website code for a news aggregator and ranker based on language used.

## API
Written with Python as a Flask build.

## UI
Written in JS/TS with React.

## `yarn start`
Runs the app in development mode at `localhost:3000`.

## `yarn serve`
Runs the api server (Flask) on at `localhost:5000`. However, there is no need for CORS as the ui has a proxy connection to the api.
